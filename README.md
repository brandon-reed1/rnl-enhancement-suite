## Enhancements

#### Github/Huboard image collapse

When viewing issues on Github or Huboard, any images inside the comment body will be replaced with a link that when clicked will hide/show the image.

Pull Requests include "Test Again" button to comment on the PR with "test this please" in order to rerun the Jenkins/Pronto tests.

#### Huboard ticket highlight for no estimate

Tickets on a Huboard board that don't have a proper estimate ([S], [M], [L], [XL], etc) will be highlighted with a red border.

#### Github/Huboard Links

External links in comments will now open in new windows.
