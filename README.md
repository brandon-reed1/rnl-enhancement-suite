#### Github image collapse

When viewing issues on Github or Huboard, any images inside the comment body will be replaced with a link that when clicked will hide/show the image.

Pull Requests include "Test Again" button to comment on the PR with "test this please" in order to rerun the Jenkins/Pronto tests.

External links in comments will now open in new windows.
